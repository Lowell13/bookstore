### This is a project to study microservices. You need to launch each one of them separately.

`API :`  
Due to an in memory database, please do not forget to add content when you launch the application with Postman or
Insomnia. You can also add a method which autofill the DB at launch.
Otherwise,you'll see nothing in the front.

`Tunnel :`  
For more information about event sourcing in Java, check here :

This is not fully implemented yet, so I recommend to not launch it and to not use it.

`API Gateway :`  
Premises of gateway is implemented it redirect calls from front to API, see here for more information :
